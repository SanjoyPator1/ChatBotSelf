It is comprised of two words Artificial and intelligence, which means a human-made thinking power. The Artificial intelligence system use such algorithms which can work with their own intelligence. It involves machine learning algorithms such as Reinforcement learning algorithm and deep learning neural networks. AI is being used in multiple places such as Siri, Google's AlphaGo, AI in Chess playing, etc. Artificial Intelligence applies machine learning, deep learning and other techniques to solve actual problems. 2.Neural Network:A neural network is a kind of machine learning inspired by the workings of the human brain. It’s a computing system made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data. 3.Deep Learning:  Deep Learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition. 4.NLP:  NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, it is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks."

                "Self-driving cars rely on hardware and software to drive down the road without user input. The hardware collects the data; the software organizes and compiles it. On the software side, the input data will normally be processed through machine learning algorithms or complex lines of code that have been trained in real-world scenarios. Following are some of the algorithms of Machine Learning used in self-driving cars: 1.) Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings. Clustering algorithms define the class of problem and class of methods. Generally, clustering techniques are established using centroid-­based and hierarchical modeling approaches. 3.) Decision Matrix Algorithms: Decision matrix algorithms are essentially used for decision making. These algorithms determine the moves of the self-driving car. So, whether the car needs to take a left or a right turn, whether it needs to brake or accelerate, the answer to such questions is determined by the accuracy of these algorithms concerning classification, recognition, and prediction of the objects’ next movement."

Clustering for customer segmentation and discovery:The algorithms analyze billions of customer’s interests and identify specific customer’s interests based on their social media activities and then generate a visual report grouping people with similar interests. 2.) Regressions models for dynamic pricing:  Regression techniques in Machine Learning allow marketers to predict numerical values based on pre-existing features, which in turn optimizes the different aspects of the customer journey. Regression techniques also helps in sales forecasting and in optimizing marketing spend. 3.)Text extraction and summarization for trending news:  Marketers can leverage ML to extract relevant content from online news articles and other data sources to determine how people view their brand and or react to their products. ML algorithms using APIs such as ALYIEN can be used to aggregate relevant news, social media sentiments monitoring, and other purposes."

Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions. Each transaction is seen as a set of items (an itemset).

It generates candidate item sets of length k from item sets of length k-1. Then it prunes the candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent k-length item sets.

"A Reinforcement Learning problem can be best explained through games. Let’s take the game of PacMan where the goal of the agent (PacMan) is to eat the food in the grid while avoiding the ghosts on its way. The grid world is the interactive environment for the agent. PacMan receives a reward for eating food and punishment if it gets killed by the ghost (loses the game). The states are the location of PacMan in the grid world and the total cumulative reward is PacMan winning the game. In order to build an optimal policy, the agent faces the dilemma of exploring new states while maximizing its reward at the same time. This is called ​Exploration vs Exploitation trade-off​. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)​ are mathematical frameworks to describe an environment in reinforcement learning and almost all RL problems can be formalized using MDPs.  An MDP consists of a set of finite environment states S, a set of possible actions A(s) in each state, a real valued reward function R(s) and a transition model P(s’, s | a). However, real world environments are more likely to lack any prior knowledge of environment dynamics. Model-free RL methods come handy in such cases. Q-learning​ is a commonly used model free approach which can be used for building a self-playing PacMan agent. It revolves around the notion of updating Q values which denotes value of doing action ​a in state ​s ​ . The value update rule is the core of the Q-learning algorithm."

"Q-learning and SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) are two commonly used model-free RL algorithms. They differ in terms of their exploration strategies while their exploitation strategies are similar. While Q-learning is an off-policy method in which the agent learns the value based on action a* derived from the another policy, SARSA is an on-policy method where it learns the value based on its current action ​a ​ derived from its current policy. These two methods are simple to implement but lack generality as they do not have the ability to estimate values for unseen states. This can be overcome by more advanced algorithms such as ​Deep Q-Networks​ which use Neural Networks to estimate Q-values. But DQNs can only handle discrete, low-dimensional action spaces. DDPG(Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)​is a model-free, off-policy, actor-critic algorithm that tackles this problem by learning policies in high dimensional, continuous action spaces. "

				"Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where we do not need to supervise the model. Instead, we need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It’s important to gain insight into the way the system behaves without supervision. For example, GAN, CNN, K-NN, etc.Deep learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. It all depends on how we want to use it. Deep learning is used for highly scalable datasets and algorithms which are complex for machine learning algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression etc., to model. For example, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be both supervised or unsupervised. If we want to classify images, we need to add dense layers and for classification, the training will be supervised. But, if we want to cluster images based on similarities of a group of images, we will extract the features using CNN and then use an unsupervised method like k-means or DBSCAN clustering."

Hence, we will now make a circle with BS as the center just as big as to enclose only three datapoints on the plane. The three closest points to BS are all RC. Hence, with a good confidence level, we can say that the BS should belong to the class RC. Here, the choice became very obvious as all three votes from the closest neighbor went to RC. The choice of the parameter K is very crucial in this algorithm. Next, we will understand what are the factors to be considered to conclude the best K."
